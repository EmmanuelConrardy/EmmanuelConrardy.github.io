<h3>Type 1 and Type 2 decisions</h3>
<p>When faced with decision fatigue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type 1 decisions are difficult or impossible to reverse. They
represent a large amount of risk. You should invest in a thorough
decision making process and proceed carefully.</li>
<li>Type 2 decisions are reversible. If they don’t work out, you can
always go back or quickly adjust course.</li>

<h3>Theory of Constraints</h3>

improve the system’s output.</p>

to fix this production issue first”</p>

<h2>Part 3 : shaping Environment and Culture</h2>

</section>

<section>
<section id="shaping-environment-and-culture"
class="title-slide slide level2">
<h2>Shaping Environment and Culture</h2>
<ul>
<li>the physical space, social norms, and organizational structures
around us significantly influence our behaviors, based on behaviorism
principles.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="adjusting-stimuli-to-influence-behavior"
class="slide level3">
<h3>Adjusting Stimuli to Influence Behavior</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changes in the environment modify the stimuli people encounter,
which in turn affects their reactions and behaviors.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example-of-adjustment" class="slide level3">
<h3>Example of Adjustment</h3>
<ul>
<li>“flexible work hours”</li>
<li>Allows employees to choose their working times within certain
limits, aligning work with their most productive hours and family
constraints.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example-of-behavioral-influence" class="slide level3">
<h3>Example of Behavioral influence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increased job satisfaction, as employees feel they have more control
over their work-life balance.</li>
<li>Employees feel more energetic and focused.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="example-of-culture-influence" class="slide level3">
<h3>Example of culture influence</h3>
<ul>
<li>as work-life balance become the norm, they contribute to a culture
of well-being, productivity, and mutual respect.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cyclical-nature" class="slide level3">
<h3>Cyclical Nature</h3>
<p>This process is not linear but cyclical. The evolving culture can, in
turn, influence the environment by shaping policies, physical layouts,
and social norms, which then continue to influence individual and
collective behaviors.</p>
</section>
<section id="sustainable-change" class="slide level3">
<h3>Sustainable Change</h3>
<p>For change to be sustainable, it’s crucial to recognize this cycle.
By carefully designing the environment to promote desired behaviors and
by nurturing these behaviors to influence culture, organizations can
create a self-reinforcing cycle of positive change.</p>
</section>
<section id="strategic-approach" class="slide level3">
<h3>Strategic Approach</h3>
<p>Leaders should strategically assess which environmental changes will
most effectively drive the desired behaviors and, ultimately, the
desired cultural shift. This might involve redesigning workspaces,
modifying policies, adjusting reward systems, or shifting communication
practices</p>
</section>
<section id="example-of-types-of-culture-to-aim-for-an-rd"
class="slide level3">
<h3>example of types of culture to aim for an R&amp;D</h3>
<pre><code>Innovative Culture: Encourages continuous exploration of new technologies, methodologies, and practices. It&#39;s about creating an environment where creative thinking and novel solutions are highly valued and supported.

Learning Culture: Emphasizes the importance of continuous learning, skill development, and knowledge sharing among team members. This culture supports staying current with the latest technological advancements and industry trends.

Collaborative Culture: Promotes teamwork and cross-functional collaboration. Given the complexity of software development, effective communication and collaboration across different roles and expertise areas are essential for solving problems and innovating.

Agile Culture: Aligns with the principles of agile software development, focusing on flexibility, customer feedback, and iterative progress. It prioritizes adaptability to change and rapid response to evolving requirements or challenges.

Customer-centric Culture: Even in R&amp;D, understanding and prioritizing the needs and experiences of the end-users of the technology is crucial. This involves integrating user feedback into the development process to ensure the solutions meet real-world needs.

Performance-oriented Culture: While fostering innovation and learning, maintaining a focus on delivering results and meeting project milestones is essential. This culture balances exploration with execution, ensuring that R&amp;D efforts contribute to tangible outcomes.

Integrity and Ethical Culture: Especially important in R&amp;D, where intellectual property, data privacy, and ethical considerations are at the forefront. Maintaining high ethical standards in research practices and respecting confidentiality are critical.

Sustainability Culture: With growing emphasis on ethical tech and sustainability, incorporating environmental and social considerations into software design and development is increasingly important.</code></pre>
