## Part 1 : leadership overview

## For Organizational Success

- How to survive and thrive in a Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous world
- The importance to understand how teams works

## What Makes a Leader?

- Communication: empathy, listening, honesty, ... The cornerstone of effective leadership.
- Inspiration vs. Management: Elevating teams beyond day-to-day tasks.

### Inspiration example

> I don't have all the good ideas, and I'll make a lot of mistakes if you don't help me lead us.

## Lifelong Learning in Leadership

- Leadership is akin to being a perpetual student
- read, listen, practice, get feedbacks, be mentored, repeat

### Book example

- The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
- A powerful model and step-by-step guide
- Reading affect your vision of the world

## Part 2 : leadership skills

## Developing Critical Thinking

- Understand the world around you
- Steps: Identify, Analyze, Evaluate, and Implement.

### Critical Thinking example

- Example: Solving a team conflict about perception of low income and managerial misstep.

### resolve conflict step 1 - Identify

- Q: Understand the root cause of apparent disengagement and why it is happening.
- A: Low income and managerial misstep is the root cause

### resolve conflict step 2 - analyse

- Q: Why is this happening?
- A: Past financial difficulties

### resolve conflict step 2.1 - analyse

- Q: How does this income compare to the local market and to other team members?
- A: Below the local market average and lower than that of recently hired team members

### resolve conflict step 3 - evaluate

- Q: What would be considered a sufficient raise?
- A: An 20% raise would be sufficient and do not overstress the company's budget.
- Example: 40k + 20% -> 48k

### resolve conflict step 4 - implement

- Q: Is the manager/team inclined to address this issue?
- A: Yes, managing conflicts about income has become a draining task.

### resolve conflict step 4.1 - implement

- Q: What changes should be made to our income policy to prevent this situation?
- A: Implementing a policy shift that emphasizes raises to match the average local market income is recommended.

## The Power of Active Listening

- Key components: Hearing, Understanding, Evaluating, Responding.
- Active listening in leadership scenarios.

### Rephrasing and genuine curiosity

> Randy: "Every week feels like I'm just guessing what's the priority because nothing is explicitly stated."

> Evan: "So, if I understand, the lack of explicitly stated priorities leaves you guessing and unsure of what to focus on? Every single week ?"

## Emotional Intelligence in Leadership

- Understanding and managing emotions in the workplace.
- Practical exercise: Recognizing team members' emotions.

### First response acknowledge and validate

> Randy: "I can work with him anymore ! He lacks everything to do his job properly."

### Do acknowledge and validate

> Evan: "It's understandable to feel upset when teamwork doesn't go as expected."

> Evan: "We'll approach this as a team issue, not just pointing out problems but seeking solutions."

### Do not dismiss

> Randy: "I can work with him anymore ! He lacks everything to do his job properly."

> Evan: "Here you go again... you're always grumpy, aren't you?"

## Leveraging Mental Models for Decision Making

- Type 1 and Type 2 decisions.
- Theory of Constraints.
- Eisenhower Decision Matrix

### Type 1 and Type 2 decisions

When faced with decision fatigue:

- Type 1 decisions are difficult or impossible to reverse. They represent a large amount of risk. You should invest in a thorough decision making process and proceed carefully.
- Type 2 decisions are reversible. If they don’t work out, you can always go back or quickly adjust course.

### Type 1 and Type 2 decisions - example

- Type 1: "Should I marry this person?"
- Type 2: "Should we cook rice or pasta tonight?"

### Type 1 and Type 2 decisions - software engineering example

- Type 1: "Which technology stack should we use: Python or C++?"
- Type 2: "Should we indent with tabs or spaces?"

### Theory of Constraints

When the workflow is disrupted:

> The Theory of Constraints (TOC) posits that every system has a bottleneck that limits its overall performance.

> Addressing areas other than the bottleneck won’t significantly improve the system's output.

### Bottleneck example

> Randy: "What are the topics, we should work on next weeks ?"

> Evan: "I got this, I'll share the topics asap, I just need more time to fix this production issue first"

### Bottleneck example - identification

    Preparing the technical specification <- constraint
    Sprint planning
    Coding
    Code review
    Testing
    Deployment into the production
    Collecting feedback and data

### Bottleneck example - resolution

> Randy: "I'll handle the production issue. You can focus on preparing our technical specifications."

> Evan: "Thanks, in the next sprint, let's allocate some time to help the team become capable of taking on these kinds of tasks."

### Eisenhower Decision

    Do: Tasks that are urgent and important. <- primary focus
    Plan: Tasks that are important but not urgent.  <- secondary focus
    Delegate: Tasks that are urgent but not important.
    Eliminate: Tasks that are neither urgent nor important. <- ignore

### Eisenhower Decision Matrix

|                   | **Urgent** | **Not Urgent** |
|-------------------|:----------:|:--------------:|
| **Important**     | Do         | Plan           |
| **Not Important** | Delegate   | Eliminate      |

## Part 3 : shaping Environment and Culture

## Shaping Environment and Culture

- the physical space, social norms, and organizational structures around us significantly influence our behaviors, based on behaviorism principles.

### Adjusting Stimuli to Influence Behavior

- Changes in the environment modify the stimuli people encounter, which in turn affects their reactions and behaviors.

### Example of Adjustment

- "flexible work hours"
- Allows employees to choose their working times within certain limits, aligning work with their most productive hours and family constraints.

### Example of Behavioral influence

- Increased job satisfaction, as employees feel they have more control over their work-life balance.
- Employees feel more energetic and focused.

### Example of culture influence

- as work-life balance become the norm, they contribute to a culture of well-being, productivity, and mutual respect.

### Cyclical Nature

This process is not linear but cyclical. The evolving culture can, in turn, influence the environment by shaping policies, physical layouts, and social norms, which then continue to influence individual and collective behaviors.

### Sustainable Change

For change to be sustainable, it's crucial to recognize this cycle. By carefully designing the environment to promote desired behaviors and by nurturing these behaviors to influence culture, organizations can create a self-reinforcing cycle of positive change.

### Strategic Approach

Leaders should strategically assess which environmental changes will most effectively drive the desired behaviors and, ultimately, the desired cultural shift. This might involve redesigning workspaces, modifying policies, adjusting reward systems, or shifting communication practices

### example of types of culture to aim for an R&D

    Innovative Culture: Encourages continuous exploration of new technologies, methodologies, and practices. It's about creating an environment where creative thinking and novel solutions are highly valued and supported.

    Learning Culture: Emphasizes the importance of continuous learning, skill development, and knowledge sharing among team members. This culture supports staying current with the latest technological advancements and industry trends.

    Collaborative Culture: Promotes teamwork and cross-functional collaboration. Given the complexity of software development, effective communication and collaboration across different roles and expertise areas are essential for solving problems and innovating.

    Agile Culture: Aligns with the principles of agile software development, focusing on flexibility, customer feedback, and iterative progress. It prioritizes adaptability to change and rapid response to evolving requirements or challenges.

    Customer-centric Culture: Even in R&D, understanding and prioritizing the needs and experiences of the end-users of the technology is crucial. This involves integrating user feedback into the development process to ensure the solutions meet real-world needs.

    Performance-oriented Culture: While fostering innovation and learning, maintaining a focus on delivering results and meeting project milestones is essential. This culture balances exploration with execution, ensuring that R&D efforts contribute to tangible outcomes.

    Integrity and Ethical Culture: Especially important in R&D, where intellectual property, data privacy, and ethical considerations are at the forefront. Maintaining high ethical standards in research practices and respecting confidentiality are critical.

    Sustainability Culture: With growing emphasis on ethical tech and sustainability, incorporating environmental and social considerations into software design and development is increasingly important.
