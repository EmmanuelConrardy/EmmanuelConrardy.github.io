## Part 1: Leadership Overview

## Leadership Skills Help You To

- Survive and thrive in a world that is Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous (VUCA).
- Understand how teams work towards their goals.

## What Makes a Leader?

- **Trustworthiness:** We trust them for their consistent integrity and reliability.
- **Inspiration versus Traditional Management:** Elevating teams beyond day-to-day tasks.

### Inspiration Example

> "I don't have all the good ideas, and I'll make a lot of mistakes if you don't help me lead us."

## Lifelong Learning

- Being a leader is akin to being a perpetual student of leadership.
- Read, listen, practice, receive feedback, be mentored, and repeat.

### Book Example

- "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team": A powerful model and step-by-step guide.
- How reading can affect your worldview.

## Part 2: Leadership Skills

## Developing Critical Thinking

- Understand the world around you.
- Steps: Identify, Analyze, Evaluate, and Implement.

### Critical Thinking Example

- Solving a team conflict about the perception of low income and managerial missteps.

### Resolve Conflict Step 1 - Identify

- **Q:** What is the root cause of the apparent disengagement and why is it happening?
- **A:** Low income and managerial missteps are the root causes.

### Resolve Conflict Step 2 - Analyze

- **Q:** Why is this happening?
- **A:** Due to past financial difficulties.

### Resolve Conflict Step 2.1 - Analyze

- **Q:** How does this income compare to the local market and to other team members?
- **A:** It's below the local market average and lower than that of recently hired team members.

### Resolve Conflict Step 3 - Evaluate

- **Q:** What would be considered a sufficient raise?
- **A:** A 20% raise would be sufficient and would not overstress the company's budget.
  - Example: 40k + 20% -> 48k

### Resolve Conflict Step 4 - Implement

- **Q:** Is the manager/team inclined to address this issue?
- **A:** Yes, managing conflicts about income has become a draining task.

### Resolve Conflict Step 4.1 - Implement

- **Q:** What changes should be made to our income policy to prevent this situation?
- **A:** Implementing a policy shift that emphasizes raises to match the average local market income is recommended.

## The Power of Active Listening

- Key components: Hearing, Understanding, Evaluating, and Responding.
- Active listening in leadership scenarios.

### Rephrasing and Genuine Curiosity

> Randy: "Every week feels like I'm just guessing what's the priority because nothing is explicitly stated."

> Evan: "So, if I understand correctly, the lack of explicitly stated priorities leaves you guessing and unsure of what to focus on? Every single week?"

## Emotional Intelligence

- Understanding and managing emotions in the workplace.
- Practical exercise: Recognizing team members' emotions.

### Anger or frustration - example

> Randy: "I can't work with him anymore! He lacks everything needed to do his job properly."

### Do Acknowledge and Validate

> Evan: "It's understandable to feel upset when teamwork doesn't go as expected.

> Evan: "We'll approach this as a team issue, not just pointing out problems but seeking solutions."

### Do Not Dismiss

> Randy: "I can't work with him anymore! He lacks everything needed to do his job properly."

> Evan: "Here you go again... you're always grumpy, aren't you?"

## Leveraging Mental Models for Decision Making

- Type 1 and Type 2 decisions.
- Theory of Constraints.
- Eisenhower Decision Matrix

### Type 1 and Type 2 Decisions

When faced with decision fatigue:

- **Type 1 decisions** are *difficult or impossible to reverse*.
  - They carry a significant amount of risk. A thorough decision-making process should be invested in, and proceed with caution.
- **Type 2 decisions** are *reversible*.
  - If they don’t work out, you can always revert or quickly adjust your course.

### Type 1 and Type 2 Decisions - Life Example

- Type 1: "Should I marry this person?"
- Type 2: "Should we cook rice or pasta tonight?"

### Type 1 and Type 2 Decisions - Software Engineering Example

- Type 1: "Which technology stack should we use: Python or C++?"
- Type 2: "Should we indent with tabs or spaces?"

### Theory of Constraints

When workflow is disrupted:

> The Theory of Constraints (TOC) suggests that every system has a bottleneck that limits its overall performance.

> Addressing areas other than the bottleneck won’t significantly improve the system's output.

### Bottleneck Example

> Randy: "What topics should we work on in the next weeks?"

> Evan: "I've got this. I'll share the topics ASAP. I just need more time to fix this production issue first."

### Bottleneck Example - Identification

    Preparing the technical specification <- bottleneck/constraint
    Sprint planning
    Coding
    Code review
    Testing
    Deployment into production
    Collecting feedback and data

### Bottleneck Example - Resolution

> Randy: "I'll handle the production issue. You can focus on preparing our technical specifications."

> Evan: "Thanks, in the next sprint, let's allocate some time to help the team become capable of taking on these kinds of tasks."

### Eisenhower Decision

    Focus primarily on tasks that are urgent and important.
    Secondary focus on tasks that are important but not urgent.
    Delegate tasks that are urgent but not important.
    Ignore tasks that are neither urgent nor important.

### Eisenhower Decision Matrix

|                   | **Urgent** | **Not Urgent** |
|-------------------|:----------:|:--------------:|
| **Important**     | Do         | Plan           |
| **Not Important** | Delegate   | Eliminate      |

## Part 3: Shaping Environment and Culture

## Shaping Environment and Culture

The physical space, social norms, and organizational structures significantly influence our behaviors, based on behaviorism principles.

### Adjusting Stimuli to Influence Behavior

Changes in the environment modify the stimuli people encounter, which in turn affects their reactions and behaviors.

### Example of Adjustment

Introducing "flexible work hours" allows employees to align work with their most productive hours and family constraints, enhancing satisfaction.

### Example of Behavioral Influence

Employees experience increased job satisfaction as they gain more control over their work-life balance, leading to heightened energy and focus.

### Example of Culture Influence

As work-life balance becomes the norm, it contributes to a culture of well-being, productivity, and mutual respect.

### Cyclical Nature

This process is cyclical, not linear.

The evolving culture can influence the environment, shaping policies, physical layouts, and social norms, which continue to influence behaviors.

### Sustainable Change

For change to be sustainable, recognizing this cycle is crucial.

Designing the environment to promote desired behaviors and nurturing these behaviors to influence culture can create a self-reinforcing cycle of positive change.

### Strategic Approach

Leaders should assess which environmental changes will most effectively drive desired behaviors and the desired cultural shift.

This may involve redesigning workspaces, modifying policies, adjusting reward systems, or shifting communication practices.

### Examples of Cultures to Aim for in R&D

    Innovative Culture: Promotes creativity and new technology adoption.

    Learning Culture: Emphasizes skill growth and knowledge exchange.
    
    Collaborative Culture: Encourages team synergy and interdisciplinary cooperation.
    
    Agile Culture: Focuses on adaptability and swift change management.
    
    Customer-centric Culture: Prioritizes fulfilling user needs via feedback.
    
    Performance-oriented Culture: Aims for results while fostering innovation.
    
    Integrity and Ethical Culture: Maintains strict ethical standards and confidentiality.
    
    Sustainability Culture: Embeds eco-friendly and social values in development.
